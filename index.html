          The term solar panel is informal for a <code>photo-voltaic (PV) module</code>. A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework ready for installation. Sunlight is a source of energy that photo-voltaic cells use to generate direct current electricty. A large collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. An array of photo-voltaic system supply solar electricity to electrial equipment. Besides using the solar panels for agriculture it is most commonly used for solar water heating systems.</p>

          Photovoltaic modules use light energy from the Sun to generate electricty. Majority of the modules use wafer-based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells. The structual member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. The cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture or the cells could get ruined. Most modules are rigid, but ones based on thin-film cells are semi-flexible. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to the desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. To determine the wattage of the module it's the mathematical product of the volatge and the amperage.

         A PV junction box is attached to the back of the solar panel and fucntions as its output interface. Most photovoltaic modules use <code>MC4 connectors</code> for external connections to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Module electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage or in parallel to provide a desired current capability of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals.

             In 1839, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel first observed the ability of some materials to create and electrical charge from light exposure.
           </li>
           <li>
             The premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used asa n instrument to measure light.
           </li>
           <li>
             In 1873 the observation by Becquerel was replicated when WIlloughby Smith discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.
           </li>
           <li>
             William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Days published "The action of light on selenium" in 1876, describing the experiment they used to replicate Smith's results.

             The first commerical solar panel was created by Charles Fritts in 1881. However these solar panels were very inefficient, espically compared to coal fired power plants.
           </li>
           <li>
             Russel Ohl in 1939 created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. He patented his design in 1941.
           </li>
           <li>
             In 1954, this design was first used by Bell Labs to create the first commerically viable silicon solar cell.
           </li>
           <li>
             In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs. The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efeciency.

          Each module is rated by its <code>direct current (DC)</code> output power under standard test conditions. Power typically ranges from 100 to 365 Watts (W). The efficiency of a module determines the are of a module given the same rated output, an 8% efficient 230 W module will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 230 W module. Some commercially available solar modules exceed 24% efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on construction, photovoltaic modules can produce electricity from a range of frequencies of light, but usually cannot cover the entire solar range (specifically, ultraviolet, infrared and low or diffused light). Hence, much of the sunlight energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with visible light from a narrow band of wavelengths. Another design concept is to split the light into six to eight different wavelength ranges that will produce a differenct color of light and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges. By using this design it has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists from Spectrolab, have reported development of multi junction solar cells with an efficiency of more than 40%. The Spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45% or even 50% in the future, with theoretical efficiencies being about 58% in cells with more than three junctions.

          Micro-inverted solar panels are wired in parrellel, which produces more output than normal panels wired in series, with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the <code>"Christmas light effect".</code> Micro-inverters work independently to enable each panel to contribute its maximum possible output for a given amount of sunlight.

          Most solar modules are currently produced from <code>crystalline silicon (c-Si)</code> solar cells made of multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90% of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of thin-film technologies using cadmium telluride, CIGS and amorphous silicon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third generation solar technologies use advanced thin-films cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular multi-junction (MJ) cells are preferably used in solar panels on spacecrafts, as they offer the highest ration of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are compound semiconductors and made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials.

        <h4>Thin Film</h4>
          <p>
            In rigid thin-film modules, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass substrate or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created in a so-called "monolithic intergation". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back sheet, usually another sheet of glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the photoactive layer and other necessary layers on a flexible substrate. If the substrate is an insulator then monolithic intergration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by laminating them to a transparent colorless fluoropolymer on the front side and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.

                Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC). The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature, and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current , or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on

              For optimum performance, a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular to direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sun chart and tracked using a solar tracker. The overall performance of a panel may be affected by differences in voltage or current of modules. To optimize the output bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels.

              The ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, hail, heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by the manufacturer, although in the U.S. most solar panels ar UL listed meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail. Many manufacturers offer a limited warranty, for the crystalline silicon module, that guarantees electrical production for 10 years a 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.

              Potential induced degradation (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules which is caused by so-called stray currents. This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.

        Solar panel conversion efficiency, which is typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. According to Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute of NanoEnergy, says "A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas". The Institue for NanoEngery specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.

        Researchers found that panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a 20$ gain in electricty production until the summer drought ends. There may also be occupational hazards of solar panel installation and maintenance.

        Most parts of a solar module can be recycled up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.
      </p>
      <p>  
      Recycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process. The module is then crushed in a mill where the different fractions are separated- glass, plastics and metals. It is possible to recover more than 80% of the incoming weight. This process can be performed by flat glass recyclers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-silicon based modules: they require specific recycling technologies such as the use of chemicals baths in order to separate the different semiconductor materials. For cadmium telluride modules, the recycling process begins by crushing the module and subsequently separating the different fractions. This recycling process is designed to recover up to 90% of the glass and 95% of the semiconductor materials contained.

      The production of PV systems has followed a classic learning curve effect, with significant cost reduction and large rises in efficiency and production output.

      With over 100% year on year growth in PV system installation, PV module makers dramatically increased their shipments of solar modules in 2010. They actively expanded their capacity and turned themselves into gigawatt (GW) players. According to PVinsights, five of the top ten PV module companies in 2010 are GW players.

      The price of solar electrical power has continued to fall so that in many countries it has become cheaper than ordinary fossil fuel electricity. Average pricing information divides in three pricing categories: those buying small quantities, mid-range buyers, and large quanity buyers. Over the long term there is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and modules. For example, in 2012 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about 0.60$ US, which was 250 times lower than the cost in 1970 of 150$ US.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real world energy production costs depend a great deal on local weather conditions. In a cloudy country such as the United Kingdom, the cost per produced kWh is higher than in sunnier countries like Spain. For merchant solar power stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price.
